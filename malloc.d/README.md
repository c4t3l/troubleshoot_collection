# Malloc Collection

This is just a tiny collection of c progs that allocate memory.  They are intended to be used to understand how the operating system behaves when placed under different types of memory loads.  They are intentionally simple to implemement and understand. These are intended for use on linux.

**Compiling**

gcc -v <malloc_prog.c> -o <name_of_your_choice>
